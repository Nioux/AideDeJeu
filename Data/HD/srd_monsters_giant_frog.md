## Special Features

**_Amphibious_**. The frog can breathe air and water.

**_Standing Leap_**. The frog's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

**_Bite_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the frog can't bite another target.

**_Swallow_**. The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md) and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
