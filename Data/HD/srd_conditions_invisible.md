* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.
