* A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.

* The creature is [incapacitated](srd_conditions_incapacitated.md) (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.

* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

* The creature has resistance to all damage.

* The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.
