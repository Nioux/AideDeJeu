**_Turning Defiance_**. The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

_Hit_: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**_Claws_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
